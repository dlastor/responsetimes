### Research Team

Kevin Brosnan is a passionate developer of statistical techniques to address real life problems. He completed a B.Sc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Limerick, with a major in Statistics in August 2014. Kevin is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Limerick with a thesis titled "Statistical Modelling with Application to Flow Cytometry & Sports Science". Flow Cytometry is used across industries such as medical diagnostics and dairy sciences, however the current statistical methods do not compliment the technology used. Developing these improved statistical methods is the aim of the research. The fair and impartial refereeing of elite athletics is the research area of sports science which Kevin is currently working on. Kevin also has vast industry experience in Management Consultancy (Accenture), Banking (AIB) and developing analytic tools for multinational companies (Accenture).

Dr. Kevin Hayes holds the position of senior lecturer (statistics) in the department of mathematics and statistics and is co-PI (with Professors Stephen O'Brien, and Eugene Benilov) of the applied mathematics and statistics SFI funded research group <a href="http://www.macsi.ul.ie" target = "_blank_">MACSI</a>. Dr. Hayes' main research area concerns the statistical analysis of curve data as applied to the area of human biomechanics, in collaboration with Doctors Drew Harrison (PESS) and Norma Bargary (MACSI). Kevin's current research is concerned with developing mathematical and statistical models to help understand the relationship and interaction between biomechanical function and muscular stimulus. He also has considerable experience analysing large epidemiological / population based data sets and data from biomedical applications. 

Prof. Drew Harrison is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Physical Education and Sports Sciences at the University of Limerick. Drew established and co-directs the Biomechanics Research Unit at the University of Limerick. He was President of the International Society of Biomechanics in Sport and has authored or co-authored over 100 international peer-reviewed publications, 5 book chapters, one co-edited book on biomechanics and several international keynote presentations. He is a member of the editorial board for the peer reviewed journal 'Sports Biomechanics' and is a regular reviewer for many peer reviewed journals. Drew is an IAAF Elite Athletics Coach and has coached many track and field athletes at all levels including, European, World and Olympic Games.
